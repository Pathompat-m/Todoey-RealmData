# Todoey-RealmData 

## Overview

Todoey is a comprehensive to-do list app featuring CRUD functionality. Users can create parent and child tasks, Read data instantly, Update task completion status, and Delete tasks effortlessly. Powered by SwiftCellkit from CocoaPods, tasks can be swiped left to delete. Data is securely stored in the Realm database. The UI boasts a vibrant array of random and gradient colors, enhanced by the Chameleon Framework from CocoaPods, which dynamically adjusts text color for improved readability against changing backgrounds.
